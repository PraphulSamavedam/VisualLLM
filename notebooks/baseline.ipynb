Be more specific about the bird\\'s tail color: Instead of simply stating that the bird\\'s tail is \"blue,\" provide more detail about the shade of blue, such as \"sky blue\" or \"navy blue.\"\\n3. Use contextual information: Consider the context of the image and the question being asked. For example, if the image shows a group of birds perched on a branch, you might want to use more specific adjectives to describe the branch, such as \"sturdy\" or \"slender.\"\\n\\nBy using these techniques, you can generate a more accurate and informative image caption that can help answer the question more effectively.'}]\n",
